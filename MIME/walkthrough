On the upload section, we can upload anithing if we intercep the request and modify the header to lie on the content of the file.

We need a fake image file with some code inside, but with the right extension so file.php.jpg.

We need Tamper Data on google chrome, and set the modify Request then we need to say that the content is an image, so image/jpg.

Then we see :

	"/tmp/mime.php.jpg succesfully uploaded."
